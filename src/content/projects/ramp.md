## Overview

The Research Accelerator for Multiple Processors (RAMP) project at UC Berkeley focused on developing FPGA-based hardware for computer architecture research. My contributions centered on floating-point unit design and embedded firmware development.

## Key Contributions

### IEEE754 Double Precision Floating Point Unit
- Designed and began developing a fully IEEE754-compliant double precision floating point unit
- Targeted for Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs
- Aimed to provide high-performance floating-point computation for research workloads

### SystemACE Firmware
- Designed and developed firmware for the Xilinx SystemACE compact flash controller
- Enabled streamlined FPGA configuration and boot processes

## Context

This project was part of my undergraduate research at UC Berkeley's Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC), where I worked on FPGA platforms that would later evolve into the BEE (Berkeley Emulation Engine) series of systems.
